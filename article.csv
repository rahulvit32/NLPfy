"6.1 Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs) sector in India comprises various types of financial institutions with each one of them having its roots at a particular stage of development of the financial sector. All-India financial institutions (AIFIs), largely an outcome of the development planning in India, were created for long-term financing. Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), on the other hand, are mostly private sector institutions which provide a variety of services including equipment leasing, hire purchase, loans, and investments. Primary dealers (PDs), which came into existence in 1995, have played an important role in both the primary and secondary Government securities market. Although commonly grouped as NBFIs, the nature of operations of FIs, NBFCs and PDs are quite different from each other. The regulatory focus in respect of these three types of NBFIs is also different. Business operations and financial performance of these entities are driven mainly by sector-specific factors.

6.2 NBFCs perform a diversified range of functions and offer various financial services to individual, corporate and institutional clients. They have been helping to bridge the credit gaps in several sectors where the institutions like banks are unable to venture. With the growing importance assigned to financial inclusion, NBFCs have come to be regarded as important financial intermediaries particularly for the small-scale and retail sectors. The regulations governing these institutions are less rigorous as compared to banks as they are not subject to certain regulatory prescriptions applicable to banks. NBFCs-D are not subject to Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) requirements like banks but are mandated to maintain 15 per cent of their public deposit liabilities in Government and other approved securities as liquid assets. The public deposits do not have insurance cover. NBFCs do not enjoy refinance facilities from the Reserve Bank and do not have chequable deposits and are thus not part of the payment and settlement systems.

6.3 Since 2006, NBFCs were reclassified based on whether they were involved in the creation of productive assets. Under the new classification, the NBFCs were divided into three major categories, viz., asset finance companies, loan companies, and investment companies. Considering the growing importance of infrastructure finance, a fourth category of NBFCs involved in infrastructure finance was introduced in February 2010, viz., Infrastructure Finance Companies (IFCs). Subsequently, in January 2011, a new category of companies, viz., systemically important non-deposit taking core investment companies (CIC-ND-SI) were brought under regulation and supervision of the Reserve Bank.

6.4 Till recently, NBFCs-ND were subject to minimal regulation as they were non-deposit taking bodies and considered as posing little threat to financial stability. However, recognising the growing importance of this segment and its inter-linkages with banks and other financial institutions, capital adequacy and exposure norms have been made applicable to NBFCs-ND that are large and systemically important (i.e., having asset size of `100 crore and above) from April 1, 2007; such entities are referred to as NBFCs-ND-Systemically Important.

6.5 This chapter provides analysis of the financial performance and soundness indicators related to each of these segments of NBFIs during 2010-11. The chapter is organised into four sections. Section 2 analyses the financial performance of FIs. Section 3 discusses the financial performance of NBFCs-D and NBFCs- ND-SI. Section 4 provides an analysis of the performance of PDs in the primary and secondary markets, followed by Conclusions in Section 5."
